# Project Tides

Tides is a two-way chat platform between NGOs and their impact community that is built using WhatsApp API. The platform allows NGOs to chat with each of their beneficiaries and help them to uplift their lives. NGOs can work in various sectors such as healthcare, education, women empowerment, etc.

## About the prototype
This prototype repository covers the various technologies, connect the dots and test a working model of the platform. A most basic use case of the application is used to build the prototype. It follows like this:
1. A beneficiary will be able to message an NGO user via WhatsApp.
2. The message will be visible on the platform.
3. It will get labeled with relevant keywords.
4. A basic response will be suggested too.
5. The NPO user will use the suggestion from the system to form a response and then send it to the beneficiary.
